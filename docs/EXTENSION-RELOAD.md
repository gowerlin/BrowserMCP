3. **Re-apply any settings** if they were not persisted

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Extension context invalidated" Error

This happens when:
- The extension was updated while a page was still open
- Chrome updated the extension automatically
- The extension crashed and was restarted

**Solution**: Reload the extension and refresh the page.

### "Cannot establish connection" Error

This happens when:
- The content script is trying to connect to an old version
- The background script is not running

**Solution**: 
1. Reload the extension
2. Close and reopen the tab
3. Try connecting again

### Extension Not Appearing in Toolbar

If the extension icon disappears:
1. Click the puzzle piece icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Find "BrowserMCP DevTools Bridge"
3. Click the pin icon to keep it visible

## Preventing Issues

To minimize the need for reloads:

1. **Close DevTools** before connecting the extension
2. **Disconnect properly** before closing tabs
3. **Keep Chrome updated** to the latest version
4. **Monitor the console** for early warning signs

## Automated Recovery

The extension includes some automated recovery features:

- **Auto-reconnect**: Attempts to reconnect when connection is lost
- **Context validation**: Checks if the extension context is still valid
- **Error recovery**: Provides clear error messages with instructions

However, manual reload is still required in some cases.
